The best way to learn is by example, so here's a quick tutorial to get you started. After you've been through this, you can read further to understand some of the more advanced features.


.. note::
	Tutorial is under construction and will be based on the [microtest](http://github.com/epigen/microtest) repository. It's sort of half-working and you can check it out if you want. We should produce a running example with a few samples and a basic pipeline that has no install requirements.
